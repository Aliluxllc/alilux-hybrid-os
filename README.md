# 🧠 Hybrid OS – A Human-Driven Analog-Digital Operating System

**By Alilux LLC – Founded by Ali Pour in Newport Beach, CA, USA**

---

## 🕰️ Inspired by Swiss Watch Precision, Built for the Human Era

**Hybrid OS** is a revolutionary computing concept built entirely on **state-machine logic**, **hand-drawn design principles**, and **biological inspiration**. This is not just software — it's a movement to return intelligence and control to the human mind.

We blend **analog state machines**, **chemical circuit design** (e.g. water, salt, organic materials), and **AI collaboration** to form a **new computing philosophy** that prioritizes:

- 📜 Transparency  
- 🧬 Biological interface  
- 🛠️ Hardware rooted in physics, not corporate bloat  
- 🌍 Universality for all: Kids, Elders, Engineers, Artists

## 🔭 Our Mission

To build a computing platform that:

- Works without screens or addictive interfaces
- Reads mood, light, and sound as part of its logic loop
- Can be simulated or constructed from **salt, water, light, and magnetic fields**
- Supports education, aviation, agriculture, and creative fields
- Encourages **hand-drawn open hardware** as the new gold standard
