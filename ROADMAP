## Phase 2 â€“ Team Formation & Prototype Design (Months 4â€“6)

1. **Core Team Building**

   * Hire/engage:

     * 2 Mechanical Engineers (analog logic experts)
     * 1 Electronics Engineer (sensors & biofeedback)
     * 1 Software Lead (simulator & digital integration)
     * 1 Community Coordinator (volunteer & outreach)
   * Onboard volunteers for research assistance (10â€“15 students).
2. **Design Workshops**

   * Conduct weekly hand-drawing sessions: analog circuit sketches, state-machine diagrams.
   * Record and digitize sketches; upload to GitHub `docs/system_diagrams`.
3. **Early Prototype Development**

   * Build first bench prototype: salt-powered logic gate module and mechanical timing rotor.
   * Document build process and initial test results.

## Phase 3 â€“ Pilot Testing & University Partnerships (Months 7â€“9)

1. **Pilot Deployments**

   * Install prototype kits at partner locations:

     * Newport Beach High School makerspace
     * Partner lab at University of California, Irvine
     * Technical university in Germany (e.g., RWTH Aachen)
   * Gather feedback and iterate designs.
2. **Academic Collaboration**

   * Formalize research projects with 3 universities (one per region).
   * Joint workshops on analog computing in local campuses.
   * Publish whitepaper on early lessons and share on arXiv.
3. **Public Demonstrations**

   * Present at local tech meetups and Maker Faires.
   * Host a Hackathon weekend focusing on physical state-machine puzzles.

## Phase 4 â€“ Expansion & Documentation (Months 10â€“12)

1. **Refined Prototypes**

   * Develop integrated laptop remote and small embedded modules.
   * Add biofeedback sensors (temperature, skin contact) to prototype.
   * Conduct safety and reliability tests.
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**

   * Finalize user manuals, build guides, and hand-drawn blueprints.
   * Translate core documentation into German and Farsi.
3. **Broader Outreach**

   * Launch full GitHub Pages sites for Hybrid OS and Mist Vape.
   * Social media campaign across LinkedIn, Twitter, and local news outlets.
   * Establish an online community forum (Discourse).

## Phase 5 â€“ Launch & Sustainability (Year 2+)

1. **Official Product Launch**

   * Release Hybrid OS simulator v1.0.
   * Open preorders for DIY prototype kits.
2. **Long-Term Community Governance**

   * Form user committee including students, educators, and community members.
   * Establish a non-profit foundation to steward open development.
3. **Scale & Diversify**

   * Extend technology to aviation controls, agricultural automation, and healthcare devices.
   * Seek larger grants (NSF, EU Horizon) and corporate sponsors.
